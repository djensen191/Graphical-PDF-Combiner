# Graphical-PDF-Combiner
A Python script to use as a graphical front-end for the pdftk command line utility. Note: Currently use of this script requires Bash, ZSH, or another unix terminal to execute.  It also requires having the pdftk utility already installed.   

This project is something that I started to improve my skills interfacing Python with the capabilities of Bash.  It is also a training ground for working with the Python graphical  library Tkinter.  This project is really still in its infancy.  I need to finish the PDF combination features as well as build in error correction and detection features.

After these basics are complete future edits may include: PDF encryption/decryption and PDF page seperation.
